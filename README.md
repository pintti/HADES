## What is HADES

Helper for Aerial Drone EcoSystem (HADES) is a proof-of-concept for a better working drone communication network. HADES is composed by three different parts, a central server, processors for drone information and a database that contains information regarding the processors and the drones controlled by them.

## Usage

Using Docker in the main HADES folder.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This should initialize and setup the server, processors and the database.
